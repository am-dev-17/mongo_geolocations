BSON 
That BSON is a binary JSON data format
What we mean in describing BSON as lightweight, traversable, and efficient
How BSON encodes a value using explicit type information, a binary representation of the value, and explicit byte length.


CRUD Revisited 
Understand all create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations in the MongoDB query language
Are familiar with commonly used CRUD operators and how to use them
Know which data types are supported by MongoDB

-> Correctly use the insert, save, update, and findAndModify commands to create new documents
-> Match insert commands with descriptions of what they do
-> Know how to perform bulk inserts
-> Understand the uniqueness constraint of _id fields and its implications for CRUD operations

_id is a field required in every MongoDB document. The _id field must have a unique value for the collection it is used in. You can think of the _id field as the document's Primary Key. If you create a new document without an _id field, MongoDB automatically creates the field and assigns a unique BSON ObjectId. If the document contains an _id field, the _id value must be unique within the collection to avoid duplicate key error.
